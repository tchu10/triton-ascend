### 约束说明
- dot: 两个输入A[batch(optional), M, K], B[batch(optional), K, N]，M，N按照16对齐，K按照32B对齐。

- gather: triton.gather(x, index, axis)，假设x的shape为n维度，目前只支持axis=n-1。

- permute: triton.permute(x, dims)，不支持dims=[2, 1, 0]。

- trans: triton.trans(x, dims)，不支持dims=[2, 1 , 0]。

- device_print: 需要增加2个环境变量，TRITON_DEVICE_PRINT=1，TRITON_ENABLE_TASKQUEUE=0。**TRITON_ENABLE_TASKQUEUE=0可能造成程序运行不稳定，建议仅临时使用。**

- atomic_add: 不支持标量（包括长度为1的tensor）访存

- atomic_max: 不支持标量（包括长度为1的tensor）访存

- atomic_min: 不支持标量（包括长度为1的tensor）访存

- permute: 不支持不相邻轴转置，如`(0, 1, 2) -> (2, 1, 0)`

- trans: 不支持不相邻轴转置，如`(0, 1, 2) -> (2, 1, 0)`

- ALL: int8类型由于特殊处理，会占用更大的片上空间，编译时容易造成ub overflow报错，通常调整tilling即可解决

## 2. Testing
### 基础用例
各类算子的基础用例，代码路径如下，可单个用例执行，也可多线程执行所有用例
```
cd /triton-ascend/ascend/examples/pytest_ut

# 单个用例执行：test_add.py 示例
pytest test_add.py

# 多线程执行所有用例：-n 16，以16个线程执行当前目录下所有用例
pytest ./ -n 16
```
